      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>Welcome to no place; in particular, my digital forest where I plan to share ideas, articulations and design work.</p>
      <p>I am interested in spatial systems design, particularly that of the future, and how revolution and movement making informs and thinks about the world we want to live in, how that informs infrastructure and vice versa. "no place" is the english translation of the greek word ou-topos, which Thomas More derived utopia from. more on this someday.</p>
      <p>I am thinking about, and structuring, this personal blog as a digital forest, which is inspired by digital gardening, and now that I think of it, Andy Matushaks evergreen note system. It maintains the frequent and iterative process of digital gardening, but will also include an archive of each layer of articulation, akin to rings on a tree, which you can view at any time. This constant, iterative process will also be applied to the design and construction of the site, and eventually I hope to include a visual timelapse of its growth.</p>
