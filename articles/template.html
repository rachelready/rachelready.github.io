          Vernacular systems design is the current title of an independent study
          I have been working on since the summer of 2020. During the Black
          Lives Matter movement I became interested in the alternative systems
          of care and safety being advocated for by prison abolitionists. I was
          specifically curious about what architectures could be rendered from
          the intangible infrastructures of embodied relations. From the
          question "how are systems translated spatially?" emerged a breadth of
          inquiries which I titled "spatial systems design". I studied
          architecture as the primary spatial object because of the function of
          facades to mold our embodiment of systems. I presumed this to be a
          neutral capacity, equally effective for oppression as for liberation,
          failing to recognize this as the precise reason for disenfranchising
          inhabitants from spatial planning. This past summer (2023) I shifted
          my work, and its title, to reflect this realization.

          The replacement of "spatial" with "vernacular" emancipates method from
          medium, and emphasizes the (significance) of context in design process
          and product. Systems design inherits connotations of agency and locale
          from vernacular, which is defined as a dialect emerging from a people
          in place. It also retains a spatial connotation, given the extended
          term "vernacular architecture", the dialect infrastructure emerged by
          a people in place.
