        <p>
          Vernacular systems design is the current title of an independent study
          I have been working on since summer 2020. During the Black Lives
          Matter movement I became interested in the alternative systems of care
          and safety being advocated for by prison abolitionists. I was
          specifically curious about what architectures could be rendered from
          the intangible infrastructures of embodied relations. From the q "<a
            href="systransspace.html"
            >how are systems translated spatially?</a
          >", a breadth of inquiries emerged, which I titled "spatial systems
          design". I studied architecture as the primary spatial object because
          of the function of facades to mold our embodiment of systems. I
          presumed this a neutral function, but was not realistic about the
          logistical and systemic disenfranchisement of the public from spatial
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remained frustrated at a system cemented in a moment in time, and
          how slow progress is made because of it. But things do progress,
          dominant systems are designed to, and evidently outgrow the built
          environment at accelerating speed. I started to notice facades that
          bypass this disparity between rate of change in our physical
          environment and socio-economic systems, such as time, money, language.
          And the infrastructure that materialize their emergence? Information
          architecture. Unlike the physical environment, the public already has
          digital agency. The public are also already organizing in community at
          scale, generating knowledge and ideas that could inform sociotechnical
          systems. The consolidation of this knowledge is slow and often
          compromising, while social culture is rapidly emergent and nuanced.
          I'm curious about what kinds of informatic facades, can mould
          relational embodiments of autonomous/vernacular systems in the
          physical environment. Systems such as mutual
          aid and food systems.

          Vernacular systems design refers to the capacity people have to
          emergently design and sustain systems, autonomously. VSD occurs beyond
          my semantic arrangement, and is unbound to medium. Given the
          aforementioned state of public agency however, my personal engagement
          with vsd will center information architecture, as I intend to design
          and research ways that digital interfaces can enable this proceedural
          capacity

        <p>Inquiries</p>
        <ul>
          how are systems designed, mapped, modelled?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          how are different ontologies translated distinctly in the spatial map
          of a system?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <a href="sequenceclass.html">Are different types of information inherently classifiable as
          objectively sequential or objectively not-sequential?</a>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          how do autonomy and collective coexist in a systems design process? in
          the interface faciltating/modelling that process? logistical
          delegation of technical and domain capacities, decision making,
          consensus processes, proceedural and interface mechanisms for emergent
          adaptation?
