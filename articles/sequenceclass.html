        <h1>
          Are different types of information inherently classifiable as
          objectively sequential or objectively not-sequential?
        </h1>
        <p>
          An answer/answers to this question would inform increased accuracy of
          mapping and embodiment of sequential knowledge work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hypothesize that some types of information are inherently
          classifiable as objectively sequential, or objectively non-sequential
          though the yes/no, as well as the sequence patterns themselves likely
          differ across different information types and subtypes.
        </p>
        <p>
          can questions be objectively sequential or objectively not-sequential?
          (is there an objectively correct and incorrect, or accurate and
          innaccurate) sequence of a set of deduced questions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          can you deduce questions?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          are there classifications of different question deduction sequence
          structures?
        </ul>
        <p>
          can problems be objectively sequential or objectively not-sequential?
          (is there an objectively correct and incorrect, or accurate and
          innaccurate) sequence of a set of deduced problems.
        </p>
        <ul>
          can you deduce problems?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          are there classifications of different problem deduction sequence
          structures (ie justification looks like a building, first principles
          looks like tree branches (not actually))
        </ul>
        <p>
          can solutions be objectively sequential or objectively not-sequential?
          (is there an objectively correct and incorrect, or accurate and
          innaccurate) sequence of a set of deduced solutions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          can you deduce solutions?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          are there classifications of different solutions deduction sequence
          structures (ie justification looks like a building, first principles
          looks like tree branches (not actually))
        </ul>
        <p>
          what kind of knowledge and information is objectively sequential or
          objectively not-sequential? (is there an objectively correct and
          incorrect, or accurate and innaccurate) sequence of different kinds of
          sets of deduced knowledge/information?
        </p>
        <ul>
          how do you deduce different kinds of knowledge/information?
        </ul>
        <ul>
          first principles
        </ul>
        <ul>
          axioms & postulates
        </ul>
        <ul>
          logic systems
        </ul>
        <p>
          are there classifications of different knowledge/information deduction
          sequence structures (ie justification looks like a building, first
          principles looks like tree branches (not actually))
        </p>
        <p>Future Questions:</p>
        <p>
          Can these data types, their deduction logic, and their resulting
          sequence be superimposed into a flat, linear sequence to be embodied?
          How are the different data types relatively sequenced?
        </p>
        <p>
          Intuitively there would be a sequence relation of something like
          problem, question, knowledge, solution (or some arrangement)
