          Why do dominant oppressive systems persist despite majority
          opposition?
        </h1>
        <ul>
          Ring#: 1
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Ring-date: Thurs March 7, 2024
        </ul>
        <p>
          Dominant oppressive systems persist
          because they were designed to. These systems <i>are not broken</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One reason of interest is that it
          <a href="posnegenergy.html"
            >it takes more energy to embody positive than negative values due to
            differing value of labour</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The reasons of focus however relate to the broken systems idea. I am
          invested in the counter to fixing systems, and instead learning how to
          capacitate autonomous systems design, organizing, adaptation and
          embodiment. The two problems here are:
        </p>
        <p>
          a) <a href="lackcohaware.html"
            >collectives lack coherent consolidated awareness of same-intent
            initiatives, fragmentation and reiteration dilutes energy energy and
            thus efficacy</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          b) <a href="lacksysauthag.html"
            >people lack agency to thoroughly articulate and actualize ideas and
            initiatives for systems that are autonomous from dominant oppressive
            systems
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The solutions I am interested are clearly stated as the inversion of
          the latter problems. I intend to design and research ways that digital
          interfaces can enable the inverted solutions of the latter problems.
          Ideally their aggregated affect, specifically gained autonomy, will
          capacitate divestment from dominant oppressive systems, alluded to in
          the first problem listed.
        </p>
        <p>
          are these solutions inherently and inevitably contradicting? can you
          successfully, simultaneously enable coherent consolidation of informed
          initiative aND increased agency for autonomous systems design?
